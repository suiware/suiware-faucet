# Suiware Faucet - Sui Faucet Chrome Extension

An experimental Chrome Extension for getting devnet/testnet SUI tokens.

> Please note the extension relies on the official Sui faucet API which has its quota and limitations,
so currently testnet faucet is not working through the extension. Hopefully, it will change in the future.
