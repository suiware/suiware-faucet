# Suiware Faucet - Sui Faucet Chrome Extension

An experimental Chrome Extension for getting devnet/testnet SUI tokens.

> The extension relies on the official Sui faucet API which has its quota and limitations,
so currently testnet faucet is not working through the extension.

## How to install

1. Clone the project locally
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable `Developer mode`
4. `Load unpacked`
5. Pin the extension icon to the browser toolbar
